Title: Analysis and Prediction of Disordered Regions in Proteins
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Eckart Bindewald
Maintainer: Eckart Bindewald <bindewald@hood.edu>
Description: This package analyzes data about disordered (i.e. unstructured)
    regions in proteins. Starting point is the annotation of disordered regions
    from disprot. One of the ideas is to use protein structure prediction
    confidence values for this type of prediction, because one expect
    unstructured regions to lead to lower protein folding confidecnce scores.
    This idea is sketched but not fleshed out using predicted structures downloaded
    from the Alphafold Database.
